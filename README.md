# TrainSimulator

Embedded software application written in Embedded C.

This application produces digital pulses that mimic the frequency and duration
of all of the wheels of a train as if they where all passing by a wayside sensor.
An oscilliscope would be needed to measure the signal on the applicable output pins.

(You must first have downloaded Tern's Paradigm IDE desktop software)

Compile and link the .c file via the Paradigm IDE, and this will create a new .HEX file.

Burn the .HEX file into the Flash EEPROM chip of the microcontroller via the Paradigm IDE.

Or bypass compilation and simply burn the existing .HEX file.

(Step-by-step instructions on how to do this are included in the Technical Documents folder)
